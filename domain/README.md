# Domain slot

In S2 the domain is the kernel prelude, ported from permit-lang 3d47120.
`domain/domain.lang` holds the domain. At build time, `tcc -run
gen/embed.c` copies it into `build/domain.c`, so the domain is part of
`build/langc`. `langc` loads the domain first, then the program.

## What the file holds

- `family` declarations. Only this file can declare a family. In a
  program, `family` is refused with `REFUSE_DATA` (rule R1).
- `def` operations, written in the language.
- Line comments that start with `--`.

Each family, constructor, field and definition name in this file becomes
a core name. A program cannot use one of them as a new definition name
(rule R4, `REFUSE_NAME`).

## Family syntax

```
family NAME (param : T)* := ctor (field : T)* | ctor (field : T)* ...
```

- A family with only nullary constructors is an enum.
- A family with one constructor is a record. It gets one projection for
  each field name.
- A field can have the type of its own family. Such a field is recursive.
- A parameter is an index (former F15). A constructor takes the indices
  first.
- A `fold` over a family takes one argument for each constructor, in
  declaration order. A constant constructor takes a value. A constructor
  with fields takes a function. A recursive field arrives folded.

In the IR, a constructor value is a heap block. Word 0 is the constructor
index, in declaration order. Each field has a word and a trap flag.
A `fold` over a family with one recursive field lowers to a loop.
A family with two or more recursive fields cannot be folded at run time
(`REFUSE_RUNTIME_TREE`, see `docs/CAPABILITY.md`).

## The prelude

The S2 domain is the kernel prelude of permit-lang 3d47120. The kit
sample (`Color`, `Item`, `Stack`, `Tree`, `Lot`) is not in the domain: it
uses `natMul`, and the kernel has no `natMul`.

| Kind | Names |
|---|---|
| Families | `S1`, `Trunc1`, `Trunc0`, `Size`, `Parity`, `Empty`, `Bag`, `FreeMon`, `Pos`, `Word`, `ChoiceBag`, `OrbitN`, `Charter` |
| Path operations | `transport`, `subst`, `J`, `JRefl`, `trans`, `isProp`, `isSet` |
| Size and word operations | `sExtend`, `sDuplicate`, `sizeFlip`, `sizeEven`, `sizePred`, `OpPos`, `consP`, `swapFront`, `actW` |
| Free monoid operations | `fmCons`, `fmIsSet`, `fmFold`, `fmBind`, `fmMap` |
| Equivalences | `isContr`, `fiber`, `isEquiv`, `Equiv`, `idEquiv`, `isoCap`, `isoPath`, `isoToEquiv`, `ua`, `uaArrow` |

Many kernel rows in `examples/`, `test/check/` and `test/eval/expect.txt`
use these names.

## How to replace the domain

1. Write your families and definitions in `domain/domain.lang`. Keep the
   names apart from the core names in `README.md`.
2. Change the examples and the tests that use the prelude names: the
   kernel rows in `examples/`, `test/check/` and `test/eval/`, and their
   lines in the `expect.txt` files.
3. The IR rows in `test/ir/` come back at S3. Until then the gate does
   not run them.
4. Run `make check` in the kit directory. The build makes `build/domain.c`
   again when `domain/domain.lang` changes.
