/* ratify-lang S10 U1 (Q-S10-3 (a)): a port of permit-lang host/ (itself a port
 * of relay-lang 4781ca7), with engine_bytes and host import boundary checks.
 *
 * permit-lang text: The host engine of permitd, S9 U1 (Q-S9-1 (a)): relay-lang 4781ca7
 * host/engine.h (file commit 8d4382a) with the host import table
 * (EngineBinding), the data segments, the kept memory export and
 * engine_put_word.
 *
 * relay-lang text: the host engine of relayd, S8 P2b (rulings Q-S8-5 (a), Q-S8-17 (a) and
 * Q-S8-18 (a)). The engine loads a Wasm module of the writer (src/wasm.c)
 * and runs its entries. First, engine_load does the no-trap check of
 * src/wasmread.c (wasm_check): a module that is not good is a refusal. The
 * engine has a value stack bound and a call depth bound, and no step fuel.
 * It does not stop the process: each failure is a result code and a
 * message (engine_message). */
