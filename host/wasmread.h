/* ratify-lang S10 U1 (Q-S10-3 (a)): a port of permit-lang host/ (itself a port
 * of relay-lang 4781ca7), with no change.
 *
 * permit-lang text: permitd copy (S9 U1, Q-S9-1 (a)): relay-lang 4781ca7 src/wasmread.h
 * (file commit 8d4382a), with the import (2) and data (11) section ids.
 *
 * The shared reader of a Wasm module of the writer (src/wasm.c), S8 P2a
 * (rulings Q-S8-2 (a) and Q-S8-3 (a)). test/notraptool.c and the host engine
 * use it. A Reader reads the bytes from POS to END. Each read checks the
 * size first, so a short module fails with `truncated`. At a failure, the
 * function keeps the reason in WHY (only the first reason) and gives 0.
 * wasm_check is the no-trap check of S7 P5b (src/wasmread.c). */
